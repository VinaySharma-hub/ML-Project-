# ML-Project-
Project Title
Give your project a descriptive and catchy title.

Overview 🧠
Provide a brief, high-level summary of the project. Explain the problem you're trying to solve, the dataset used, and the machine learning approach you took. What is the main goal or outcome of this project?

Features ✨
List the key functionalities and features of your project. This could include:

Data preprocessing and cleaning: How was the raw data prepared?

Model training: Which algorithms were used? What were the key hyperparameters?

Evaluation metrics: How was the model's performance measured?

Inference/Prediction: How can a user make new predictions?

Project Structure 📁
Lay out the project's directory structure to help users navigate the files. This provides a clear roadmap of where everything is located. For example:

│   ├── raw/
│   ├── processed/
├── notebooks/
│   ├── data_exploration.ipynb
│   ├── model_training.ipynb
├── src/
│   ├── data_loader.py
│   ├── model.py
│   ├── train.py
├── models/
│   ├── final_model.pkl
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
Technologies and Libraries 🛠️
List all the major libraries and frameworks used in the project. It's helpful to specify versions to avoid dependency issues. A requirements.txt file is the best way to manage this, but a quick list here is a good summary.

Python (3.8+)

Pandas

Scikit-learn

TensorFlow/PyTorch

Matplotlib/Seaborn

Setup and Installation 💻
